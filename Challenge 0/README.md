# Challenge 00
## The Ultimate Intro for Ruby
This challenge is made to be a first time intro into Ruby. It contains a challenge that will take
user input, and convert it into a dollar amount, which will then calculate its GST and PST tax, and
display the full total. At the end, there are certain comments that will show up once the threshold has been
reached.
